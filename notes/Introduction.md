# OSI Layers Overview

## Introduction
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
It's a reference model which means to standardize how different computers communicate between them.
It breaks the communication into 7 layers, each layer has its own significance and work to do.

7 layers are there:

**BOTTOM**
1. Physical layer
2. Data link layer
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer

Internet is nothing but a bunch of computers connected together.

**TCP** -> Transmission Control Protocol
**Tim Berners-Lee** is the founder of World Wide Web

**WWW** - A system of web pages and resources linked together using hyperlinks and accessed via the Internet using a browser.

**HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for communication between a client and a server.

## TCP/IP Model vs OSI Model

OSI model is a reference model and not practical. Nowadays the **TCP/IP model** is used to be more practical.

### TCP/IP Model - 4 Layers:

**1. Application Layer**
- Absorbed the Application, Presentation, and Session layers from the OSI model and combined them into one layer
- Usually the browser only handles all of these three layers, so it made sense to just make this into one layer

**2. Transport Layer**
- Exactly same as that of OSI model

**3. Network Layer**
- Same as OSI

**4. Physical Layer**
- Merged Data Link and Physical layer
- Physical layer deals with frames and bitstreams
